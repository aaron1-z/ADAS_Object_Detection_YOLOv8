# ADAS_Object_Detection_YOLOv8
This project implements Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) object detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model. The model is trained and tested on the COCO-128 dataset, identifying objects such as cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, and road signs to improve vehicle safety.
